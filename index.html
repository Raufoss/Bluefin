  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

  <h1>My Dream fish: Southern Bluefin Tuna</h1>
  <p>Commonwealth stock status reports classify Southern Bluefin Tuna as 'Overfished'. Classified as "Critically Endangered" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Classified as 'Conservation Dependent' under the Australian EPBC Act. Listed as 'Endangered' by NSW DPI. AMCS lists both Wild and Farmed (ranched) Southern Bluefin Tuna as SAY NO. Southern Bluefin Tuna is on Greenpeace Australia Pacific's Seafood Redlist. Greenpeace reccomends Australian caught Skipjack Tuna as an alternative. Historically, the Southern Bluefin Tuna has been heavily exploited across its range. Use of increasingly sophisticated fishing techniques and knowledge of migratory routes have led to massive decline in stocks. 'Sea Ranching' requires huge quantities of wild caught fish to feed the tunas.</p>
